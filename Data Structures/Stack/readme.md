# Stack

A stack is a collection of elements. It can be thought of as a physical stack of items. When an element is added (pushed) to a stack, it goes to the "top" of the stack. When an element is taken out of the stack, it is also taken (popped) from the "top" of the stack. This means that the elements which are added last, are removed first and the elements which are added first, are removed last.

Stacks have a runtime of O(1) when adding an element to a stack, and a runtime of O(1) when removing an element from a stack.
