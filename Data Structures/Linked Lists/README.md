# Linked list

A linked list is a collection of nodes which are connected to each other by pointers. A singly linked list has a pointer to the first node, and each node has a pointer to the next node. A double linked list has a pointer to the first and last node, and each node has a pointer to the next and previous node. Each node also contains data.

Linked lists have a runtime of O(1) when inserting or reading data from the front of the list (and back for doubly linked lists), but have a runtime of O(n) when accessing a specific element in the list or searching the list.
