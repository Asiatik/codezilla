# Selection Sort in Java

##Introduction
The selection sort algorithm it's a very simple one, but it has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar [insertion sort](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla/tree/master/Sorting/Insertion%20Sort/Java).
Anyway, in certain situations, it can perform better than more complicated algorithms, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
