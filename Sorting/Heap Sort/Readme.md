# Heapsort
Heapsort is a comparison-based algorithm that uses the heap data structure (a binary heap). It is similar to selection sort. However, instead of searching for the element in a list (or an array), heapsort searches for the element in a complete binary tree.
The time complexity of heapsort is always O(nlogn).
