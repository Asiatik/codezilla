# Bubble Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) by comparing adjacent elements.
The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n2). However, if a sorting test is executed during the Bubble Sort execution, the best case is of time complexity is O(n) -- that is the case when the array is already sorted.
