* Binary search algorithm
* This is the exact implementation of the pseudocode written in README.
* Notice that even if the array list contains multiple items,
* it will return only one index.
* Thus this algorithm is well suited to find if a item is present.
* And not for finding the exact index if multiple items are present.
* 
* With C++ you have to be careful of integer overflows.
* So we must make sure that the length of itemList is below that of int.
* Also the size of the array must also be sent.

    int leftIndex = 0;
