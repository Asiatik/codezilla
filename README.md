codezilla ü¶ñ One giant collection of algorithms &amp; design patterns. 

> The pandora box of algorithms and data structures 

Feel free to contribute. Create an issue, let others know which algorithm/data structure you are planning to add. Fork the repo. And make a PR! 

> The goal is to create a codebase for developers to access. Later we aim to develop extensions using this codebase to support multiple IDEs.


## How To Contribute to This Project
Here are 3 quick and painless steps to contribute to this project:

__Star this repository to show your support for Asiatik__

* Add a a program to implement an algorithm in any language.
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating bubble sort in C". Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* Name your branch Like `#23 Add Bubble Sort in C`.

	Also create a directory for any new algorithm if it doesn't exist.
	eg. `observable_pattern`, `bubble_sort`.
	Inside these directories you can create a folder for the programming language you want to add. And finally add your own file named `program_name.language_extension` (`bubble_sort.cpp`)
	Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)
		
Make sure you adhere to the algorithm/language/file folder structure while adding code.

__Easiest way (Recommended)__ ‚≠êÔ∏è -You can run `bash runme.bh` on your terminal to make the appropriate file structure

Additionally we recommend using standard convention for your language such as indentation and variable naming while writing the algorithm. Useful comments will be a help. Finally, if you can write tests for you code, we urge you to do so.

* Finally, wait for it to be merged!
